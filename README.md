# Polling Magic

Polling Magic is a website desgined to gather and display information about the Magic: The Gathering fanbase. The purpose of this site for the user is to be able to like/dislike and discuss current rotating sets as part of the standard game mode in Magic: The Gathering.

## User Stories

- As a site user I can view the current opinions of other users on the latest Magic set posts so that I can select and view one.
- As a user I can register an account so that I can comment and like/dislike set posts.
- As a user I can register a unique account so I can comment and like on each set.
- As a user I can like or dislike a set post so that I can contribute to the opinion of the fan base on the site.
- As a user I can leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation.

## UX

Polling Magic was created as a space for the Magic community to have a resonable discourse about Magic: The Gathering sets. Its secondary function is to illustrate to the marketing, creative and all other relavant departments at Magic: The Gathering how thier products and services are being received by their target audience. In the future, sourcing consumer satisfication could be made a whole lot easier and streamlined thanks to sites such as this.

### Colour Scheme

The `#ff8800` orange colour was utilised as it is similar to the colour of the orginal Magic: The Gathering logo font. This original logo served as inspiration for the colour scheme. This colour was used in headings, menu bar, footer and in the logo.

A white colour `#ffffff` was used for most of the text on the site, primarily for the `<p>` sections. It was also used in the footer for social media icons and to highlight the form link.

The black colour `#f0f0f0` was used as a background colour primarily. It is found in the header and footer as a background colour and serves as an excellent contrast for the orange `#ff8800` colour. 

### Typography

The eczar font looks similar to the belern font used in Magic: The Gathering products and logos. Since the belern is a copyrighted font and cannot be used outside of Magic: The Gathering products, eczar was the font selected as most appropriate.

Rubik was the other font used throughout the site, in the main body of each section. It's simple and elegant structure was what made it suitable to use as a font, and was important when implementing a simplistic design for the site.

### Unfixed Bugs

### Deployment

- First step was to sign up to the Heroku online application using an email. Then authenticate and create your account on Heroku.

- ![Heroku Sign Up](documents/heroku-screenshots/heroku-signup.png)

- Then I went to my Heroku account dashboard and clicked new, then create new app.

- ![Heroku Dashboard](documents/heroku-screenshots/heroku-dashboard.png)

- ![Heroku Create New App](documents/heroku-screenshots/heroku-create-new-app.png)

- Next I gave my application a unique name polling-magic-community. Then I selected Europe for region.

- ![Heroku App Creation](documents/heroku-screenshots/heroku-app-creation.png)

- I installed the add on Postgres to be used as the cloud based database for this project.

- ![Heroku Addons](documents/heroku-screenshots/postgres-addon.PNG)

- After the app is created I selected the settings tab. In here I clicked on the Reveal Config Vars button. I first obtained the API key from Cloudinary (the image hosting site used in this project) site. Then input it into the config vars.

- ![Cloudinary API](documents/heroku-screenshots/cloudniary-api.PNG)

- A env.py was created were the keys for `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY` and `CLOUDINARY_URL` would be held.

- I then added a secret key into the env.py file as well as the url from the linked postgres database. 

- ![Secret Key Databse Url](documents/heroku-screenshots/secret-key-database-url.PNG)

- ![Heroku Tabs](documents/heroku-screenshots/heroku-tabs.png)

- ![Heroku Config Vars & Buildpacks](documents/heroku-screenshots/heroku-settings-tab.PNG)

- I then clicked on the Deploy tab. Here I selected GitHub as the deployment method. I then connected to my polling-magic repository on GitHub by typing it in and selecting it.

- Finally ensured that automatic deploys were from the main branch. I clicked on enable automatic deploys and built the app.

- ![Heroku Deploy Tab](documents/heroku-screenshots/heroku-deploy-tab.PNG)

- A Procfile was created into my local workspace in Gitpod. The Procfile is used for declaring what commands are run by your applicationâ€™s dynos on the Heroku platform.

- After all relevant apps were installed, the requirements.txt file was created using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Additionally all apps were listed/frozen onto this txt file using the command `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.


### Local Deployment

- All changes to the models.py file wer efollowed by the command `python3 manage.py makemigrations` & `python3 manage.py migrate`to commit and push the changes to my local workspace.
- A super user was created using the command `python3 manage.py create superuser`. This was used to sign into the sites admin page.
