## UX

### Colour Scheme

The `#ff8800` orange colour was utilised as it is similar to the colour of the orginal Magic: The Gathering logo font. This original logo served as inspiration for the colour scheme. This colour was used in headings, menu bar, footer and in the logo.

A white colour `#ffffff` was used for most of the text on the site, primarily for the `<p>` sections. It was also used in the footer for social media icons and to highlight the form link.

The black colour `#f0f0f0` was used as a background colour primarily. It is found in the header and footer as a background colour and serves as an excellent contrast for the orange `#ff8800` colour. 

### Typography

The eczar font looks similar to the belern font used in Magic: The Gathering products and logos. Since the belern is a copyrighted font and cannot be used outside of Magic: The Gathering products, eczar was the font selected as most appropriate.

Rubik was the other font used throughout the site, in the main body of each section. It's simple and elegant structure was what made it suitable to use as a font, and was important when implementing a simplistic design for the site.
